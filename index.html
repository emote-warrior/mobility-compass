        <p><strong>This is not a traditional survey with straightforward questions.</strong> Instead, you will see a series of statements — called propositions — about urban mobility and city transport.</p>
        <p>Some statements may seem bold or unclear on purpose. Their role is to capture your honest reactions and attitudes about different ideas related to getting around in cities.</p>
        <p><em>Please respond based on your immediate thoughts and feelings. There are no right or wrong answers, and your responses are anonymous and not recorded.</em></p>
